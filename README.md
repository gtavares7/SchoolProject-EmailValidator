# EmailValidator

Lightweight email-validation software made in Java. <br>
This is still a work in progress

```
WHAT IT DOES:
1. checks if email characters are alphanumeric
2. checks if email prefix includes only valid characters
3. checks if email domain includes only valid characters
4. checks if email contains only one "@"
5. More to come...
